# sanfoundry-dl

This small python app helps to extract all of the multiple choice questions found on "www.sanfoundry.com". This version is better than the first version (v1) in many ways.
<em>sanfoundry-dl v2 now supports standalone URLs as well! It's faster and less error prone (upto 40%). This version also uses a real user interface instead of boring terminal/console/shell/command_prompt! It handles all errors and even defaults back to old format if required.<em>

To use this app, you must have python3+, Google Chrome installed on your computer, and ofcourse a clone of this repository.
Open your terminal/console/shell/command_prompt and change directory to the project's cloned folder and install ll requirements using this command: <b>pip install -r requirements.txt<b>

As, this project now uses selenium, so you might need to add ChromeDriver to this location: <b>/Desktop/sanfoundry-dl/api/main/helpers/drivers/chromedriver</b>.
Here is the link to download ChromeDriver: <a href="https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads">https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads</a> Also, it's important that you must download the same version of ChromeDriver as your Google Chrome browser.

So, for example, if you are using Windows PC and you have cloned the project to your desktop, you need to copy chromedriver_with_same_version_as_chrome_for_windows.exe to this folder path "Desktop/sanfoundry-dl/api/main/helpers/drivers/"

And, the last step is to run this in your terminal/console/shell/command_prompt: <b>python3 main.py</b> or <b>python main.py</b>

Thanks for checking this project. Feel free to contribute and contact for anything.
